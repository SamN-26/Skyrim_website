                        Solitude is the capital city of both Haafingar Hold, and the province of Skyrim. 
                        Currently ruled by Jarl Elisif the Fair, widow of the late High King Torygg, it is the
                        headquarters of the Imperial Legion stationed in Skyrim. General Tullius commands the
                        Imperial army from the stone-walled Castle Dour, while Solitude's Jarl, Elisif, resides
                        in the Blue Palace. The Thalmor have an embassy hidden in the nearby mountains.

                        <br>
                        Solitude is also a major shipping port and important Imperial supply line. Solitude sits
                        on a natural arch, giving its port much needed shelter from the strong winds of the Ghost
                        Sea. Most of the shipping in Solitude is run by the Imperial-financed East Empire Company.

                        <br>
                        Solitude is located on the eastern coast of a peninsula in Haafingar, in the far northwest of
                         Skyrim. The city is built on a cape on the mouth of the Karth River and has a port on the river 
                         itself. A large percent of Haafingar's population lives within Solitude's walls. It is also one 
                         of the northernmost cities on the mainland of Tamriel.

                        Whiteun is the capital city of Whiterun Hold, in the center of Skyrim. In Whiterun, 
                        Nords live in the 'traditional' manner: their lives are simple, harsh, and rooted in ancient 
                        ideas. Even the city's fortifications—wooden and stone palisade walls and the sheer defensive 
                        advantage offered by its position on a large bluff that raises the city above the surrounding tundra—are
                        archaic by contemporary standards. Due to its central location, Whiterun serves as the commercial heart of Skyrim. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The city is home to two important dynastic families, the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns. Once on good terms with one
                        another, they are currently bitter enemies, as a result of their differing views on the civil war conflict, as well 
                        as the economic disparity between both clans, since the Battle-Borns are wealthy and the Gray-Manes are modest. Upon 
                        entering the city, the Dragonborn is able to choose a side, either Battle-Born or Gray-Mane, although this is not necessary
                        to interact with the city's shops and temple.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Riften, referred to as Rifton in earlier records is a city situated in the 
                        southeastern corner of The Rift, at the eastern end of Lake Honrich, with a good portion 
                        of the city actually spilling over the water atop large wooden piers. It is the southernmost 
                        and easternmost of all the cities in Skyrim. Fort Greenwall is a short distance 
                        beyond the guard towers at the northern gate. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The city is located in the beautiful Autumnal Forest region of Skyrim, and that beauty has
                        encroached upon the city, in the form of wondrous foliage and generally pleasant, if not sometimes 
                        overcast weather. But most of Riften's structures are wooden, and the city gives off an 
                        old and run-down feeling, which often takes visitors by surprise. Not that this bothers 
                        the residents, who see Riften for what it truly is—a bustling, energetic city with a strong 
                        economy fueled by hard-working fishermen and mead makers. Despite the fact that the current Jarl 
                        in office is Laila Law-Giver, the residents understand that the city is, for all intents and purposes, 
                        actually owned and operated by Maven Black-Briar, and in order to survive and thrive, one needs to adhere 
                        to her rules. Maven's hold over the city is so great, that in the event of an Imperial victory, Maven 
                        takes the position of Jarl after Laila is removed and banished to live in Windhelm in the Palace of the
                        Kings and remarks that it is only as a title, with her son serving as her steward.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Winterhold is a former major city which is located in northern Skyrim. It 
                        is the capital city of the hold of the same name. Once a great capital rivaling 
                        Solitude in power and importance, Winterhold is now little more than a shell of its 
                        former self due to the Great Collapse.[1] The only surviving fort in the hold is Fort 
                        Kastav to the south.

                        In 4E 122, a seemingly never-ending series of storms lashed out at the northern coast of Skyrim, 
                        eventually causing most of the city to erode alarmingly fast and be washed away into the Sea of Ghosts. 
                        This event is known as the Great Collapse. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Strangely, the College of Winterhold was unaffected, remaining firm on a now freestanding spire of rock. This 
                        has led some to believe that the mages in the College of Winterhold were experimenting, and that this was the cause 
                        of the Great Collapse. Many inhabitants of Winterhold, both mages and magic-fearing Nords, were forced to abandon the 
                        city, and those who remain still eye the College with suspicion. Alternate theories regarding the Great Collapse are held 
                        by some, however; one is that it was a result of the eruption of the Red Mountain volcano in Vvardenfell, which was not felt 
                        until years after the actual incident.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Windhelm, also known as the City of Kings, is a city located in northeastern Skyrim. It serves as the capital 
                        of Eastmarch Hold. It is also the oldest city in Skyrim, possibly the oldest city of man on Tamriel that is still 
                        standing, dating back to the Merethic Era.
                        <br>
                        After the eruption of Red Mountain, many Dunmer fled to Windhelm  and settled in an area known as the 
                        "Snow Quarter." The area has since been renamed the "Gray Quarter," as all of the Dunmer have congregated in 
                        this area. Reasons as to why vary depending on who is spoken to within the city. Some say that the Nords 
                        of Windhelm sequestered the Dunmer from the other citizens in this "Gray Quarter" in reference to the Dunmer skin color.
                        <br>
                        Argonians are also segregated from the Nord population and are forced to live at the Argonian Assemblage 
                        at the city docks. A decree by Ulfric Stormcloak forbidding the Argonians from living within the city's 
                        walls also exists. If the Imperial Legion takes over Windhelm, Brunwulf Free-Winter becomes Jarl, as a 
                        supporter of both the Dunmer and Argonians, he believes that the Argonians should remain outside of the city 
                        for their own safety, "because most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be 
                        trusted." As a result of the treatment they face at the hands of the Nords, the Argonians point out how their lives 
                        are difficult, and how the Nords do not appreciate them. Other Argonians are also warned about the living conditions 
                        in the city for Argonians, being warned that they should not want to live in Windhelm.
