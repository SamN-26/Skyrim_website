                The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published 
                by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following 2006's 
                The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 
                on November 11, 2011.
                The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost
                province of Tamriel. Its main story focuses on the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to 
                defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Over the course of the game, 
                the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open world
                tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to 
                ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.
                The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-person perspective. 
                The player may freely roam over the land of Skyrim, an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, 
                caves, cities, towns, fortresses, and villages.[1] Each city and town in the game world has jobs such as farming for the player
                to engage in.[2] Players may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, paying for a ride from a city's stable, or 
                utilizing a fast-travel system that allows them to move their character immediately to a previously discovered location.

                                    <p class="paragraph">
                                        This tome, written by Dranor Seleth, details the complete history of 
                                        the Nedes and how they came to Skyrim from Atmora, as well as how 
                                        they constructed and settled the city of Saarthal. After their arrival,
                                        the Nedes began a great alliance with the Snow Elves, and both races believed 
                                        that a lasting peace between them would endure. At some point the Snow Elves began 
                                        to fear the growing population of the Nedes, and the possibility that they might expand 
                                        beyond Saarthal and settle all of Skyrim. So the Snow Elves broke their alliance with the 
                                        Nedes by sending a legion of their troops to Saarthal in which they brutally slaughtered every
                                        last man, woman and child in the city. The remaining Nedes who survived the attack returned to
                                        Atmora to tell of the night's events. Thus they gathered the Five Hundred Companions to return 
                                        to Skyrim on the day which would later be known as the Day of Final Passage. When they landed in Skyrim 
                                        they fought a huge battle against the Snow Elves, eventually winning. Over time, the Nedes would 
                                        develop into the Nords, and would eventually settle all of Skyrim. The events which involve
                                            the entire Nede race traveling from Atmora to Skyrim would later be referred to as The Return.
                                            The event that occurred in Saarthal would later be known as the Night of Tears, and would 
                                            stay with the Nords as a part of their history and culture, as well as their hatred of the 
                                            Snow Elves and essentially all Elven-kind.

                                    <h2 class="lore-subHeading">The Battle of Red Mountain</h2>
                                    <p class="paragraph"> 
                                        The First Council was held together for hundreds of years thanks to the friendship between Dumac and Nerevar. 
                                        However, through means lost to history, Lord Voryn Dagoth of House Dagoth learned of a Dwemer scheme: deep in
                                         the bowels of Red Mountain on the island of Vvardenfell, the Dwemer had found the Heart of Lorkhan, and High 
                                         Craftlord Kagrenac planned to harness it and use it to power a giant mechanical god. Lord Dagoth 
                                         reported this to the Chimer leadership, and eventually, the Hortator Nerevar confirmed it with his patron
                                          Azura. Nerevar confronted his friend Dumac, and they quarreled bitterly (some sources assert Dumac did
                                           not know of Kagrenac's plan at the time and thus misunderstood Nerevar's concerns). As a result,
                                            Nerevar led the Chimer to war in order to stop this "profane" usurpation.
                                        <br>
                                        At the start of the war, Dwemeri forces were concentrated in the northwest of the province, and their
                                         campaign initially had great success throughout the north. There is speculation that many of
                                          the great metal automatons the Dwemer used as troops in the battle were built in the Great Workshops of 
                                          Nchardak on the island of Solstheim. The coastal Dwemeri city was reputedly able to produce one automaton 
                                          a day, an apparently impressive rate of production.[10] Many outlanders were at the battle, notably Orcs
                                           and Nords, and sources often designate them as allies of the Dwemer.
                                        <br>
                                        Nerevar, meanwhile, led his united people, the nomadic Ashlanders as well as the Great Houses 
                                        (House Redoran, in particular, likes to trumpet its substantial contribution of warriors to the battle)
                                        .Nerevar did not have full control of the Chimer forces until a series of defeats convinced the Great 
                                        Houses to relinquish command.[9] Once he had full command of the Chimer forces, Nerevar carefully orchestrated
                                         a confrontation at Dumac's citadel, a great Dwemer stronghold within Red Mountain where the Heart was being
                                          kept.

                                        The bulk of Nerevar's troops left Narsis and headed north at roughly the same time as a horde
                                         of westerners entered Morrowind from the west and began crossing the Inner Sea.Some sources 
                                         claim that all who opposed Nerevar's forces in the battle were exterminated.Others state that 
                                         while all enemies of the Chimer forces were decisively defeated, only the Dwemer were wiped out 
                                         completely.

                                        The Tiber Wars were inspired when the Greybeards told Tiber Septim that he was
                                        destined to become the Emperor of Tamriel.[2][7] After the death of Cuhlecain, 
                                        Tiber Septim took his role, and started his conquest of Tamriel in the 855th year
                                        of the Second Era or in the 854th year of the Second Era.[5][4] Tiber himself, however,
                                        found the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a time-consuming task, and, 
                                        because of this, the Underking dealt with the Imperial expansion into Skyrim and High Rock.

                                    <p class="paragraph">
                                        The Alliance War, also known as the Three Banners War, was a war that occurred during
                                         the Second Era, which began in 2E 580 shortly after the First Aldmeri Dominion was formed 
                                         when Queen Ayrenn returned to the Summerset Isles after decades of adventuring. The three 
                                         alliances involved were the First Aldmeri Dominion, the Ebonheart Pact, and the Daggerfall 
                                         Covenant, all of which were fighting to rule Tamriel.
                                         <br>
                                         In 2E 578, Emperor Varen Aquilarios was convinced by Mannimarco that he knew a ritual 
                                         which would allow him to become Dragonborn. Varen desired to further legitimize his claim 
                                         to the Imperial throne by lighting the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One in the Imperial 
                                         City, which can only be done by one of the Dragon Blood. Mannimarco and Varen were part of
                                        a group referred to as the Five Companions, which also included Sai Sahan, Lyris Titanborn
                                         and Abnur Tharn. The ritual turned out to be an elaborate trick by Mannimarco. He then
                                        incapacitated the others and declared he was a servant of Molag Bal, and the ritual was 
                                        actually one that would weaken the barriers between Mundus and Coldharbour.
                                        <br>
                                        Clivia Tharn was soon after named the new Empress Regent of Tamriel and turned the 
                                        Empire to Daedra worship, in particular Molag Bal. But Clivia's father, Abnur Tharn,
                                         who was the High Chancellor of the Elder Council and Overlord of Nibenay, despised Molag Bal 
                                        and his minions. With the Tharn family divided, Clivia convinced Mannimarco to use his necromantic
                                        abilities to resurrect Imperial Soldiers to bolster the Empire's forces. When the alliances saw
                                        that the Empire was weak, they took advantage of its weakness in an attempt to expand their territory.
                                        Thus, the war began.

                                        The Septim Dynasty was founded by the legendary Talos, who took the Cyrodilic name of Tiber
                                         Septim and later established the Third Empire of Tamriel in 2E 896 after decades of conquest, 
                                         thus marking the end of the Second Era and the advent of the Third Era.
                                        <br>
                                        Under the Septims, Tamriel prospered and its provinces enjoyed peace and stability that 
                                        had not been seen since before the chaotic centuries of the Interregnum. New conflicts would
                                         still arise, however, which would stretch the Empire to the breaking point throughout the Third Era.
                                          A battle over the royal succession ensued during the War of the Red Diamond between 3E 120 and 3E 127.
                                           The Camoran Usurper seized control of Valenwood and Hammerfell from 3E 249 to 3E 267. 
                                           Emperor Uriel Septim V spearheaded an ill-fated invasion of Akavir in 3E 288, resulting 
                                           in the emperor's death and the loss of a considerable portion of the Empire's military strength. 
                                           Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn overthrew the rightful emperor and ruled for a decade beginning in 
                                           3E 389, a period that would become known as the Imperial Simulacrum.
                                            <br>
                                        Through all of these challenges, the Empire held and the Septim line survived. Their 
                                        end came in 3E 433 with the onset of the Oblivion Crisis. Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his 
                                        heirs were assassinated by the Mythic Dawn in a single night, and the Dragonfires ceased to 
                                        burn. The Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon launched a massive invasion of Tamriel. Although one 
                                        last Septim heir, Martin Septim, was located, he sacrificed himself to repel the Daedra and seal 
                                        Mundus off from Oblivion forever. With the Septims gone and the Empire's fate uncertain, the Third 
                                        Era concluded and the Fourth Era began.

                                        The Oblivion Crisis, also known as the Great Anguish, was a total war between the Daedra and the 
                                        population of Tamriel. It began with the assassination of Uriel Septim VII and all of his known heirs
                                         in 3E 433. Shortly afterward, Oblivion Gates to the Deadlands opened across Tamriel and Daedra 
                                        poured out as the result of a fanatical cult of worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon known as the Mythic Dawn.
                                        Widespread devastation and casualties resulted across entire provinces. The Daedra besieged Skyrim, and 
                                        laid waste to the Old Holds.[5] In Black Marsh, the Hist called back many Argonians to fight off the 
                                        Daedra. According to An-Xileel the Daedra were forced to close their Oblivion gates in Black Marsh due 
                                        to Argonian counter invasion.[6] In Cyrodiil, the city of Kvatch was entirely destroyed.

                                        Adril Arano, a Second Councilor of Raven Rock in the late Fourth Era, 
                                        claimed that the Empire pulled most of its forces out of Morrowind during the 
                                        Crisis.[8] However, this contradicts the words of High Chancellor Ocato himself during
                                         the Crisis, who stated that Cyrodiil and cities such as Bruma were virtually defenseless
                                          precisely because he was both unable and unwilling to pull any troops out of the other provinces.
                                           Indeed, the Imperial Province was left almost entirely to its own devices, and no foreign legions
                                            were ever found within Cyrodiil for the entirety of the Crisis or its immediate aftermath. Still, 
                                            a history of the Raven Rock colony records that the bulk of the Imperial Guard stationed there was 
                                            recalled to Cyrodiil from the then-Nordic Solstheim, though the author's source for this matter are 
                                            the Redoran Dunmer of the settlement.

                                        The Empire was near collapse, but Uriel VII's illegitimate son, 
                                        Martin Septim, ended the invasion with the help of a mysterious hero, but
                                         the cost was enormous. Martin, the last of the Septim bloodline, sacrificed 
                                         himself and the Amulet of Kings to become an Avatar of Akatosh and cast Mehrunes Dagon 
                                         back into Oblivion. This event marked the end of the Third Era.

                                    <p class="paragraph">
                                        The White-Gold Concordat was a treaty signed in 4E 175 between the Empire 
                                        and the Aldmeri Dominion that ended the Great War. The conditions of the 
                                        treaty outlawed the worship of Talos in the Empire, formally disbanded the
                                        Blades, and delivered a large portion of southern Hammerfell into the control
                                        of the Aldmeri Dominion. Emperor Titus Mede II made these concessions to the T
                                        halmor hierarchy in order to give the Imperial Legion time to recover its strength, 
                                        as it had been decimated in the Battle of the Red Ring.
                                        <Br>
                                        The Redguards of Hammerfell, however, refused to accept the terms of the 
                                        White-Gold Concordat, and continued to resist the Thalmor. This forced Titus Mede 
                                        to officially renounce Hammerfell as a province of the Empire in order to preserve 
                                        the peace stipulated in the treaty. Viewing this as a betrayal, Hammerfell became an 
                                        independent state, and managed to fight the Dominion to a standstill, culminating in 
                                        the signing of the Second Treaty of Stros M'Kai five years later in 4E 180, which resulted
                                        in all Aldmeri forces withdrawing from Hammerfell. Hammerfell thus became an independent,
                                        if devastated, nation. Diplomatic relations between Hammerfell and the Empire remain 
                                        strained, an outcome that Legate Justianus Quintius postulates was a long-term goal of the Thalmor.

                                        Specifically, the ban enforced regarding the worship of Talos greatly angered the people 
                                        of Skyrim. The Stormcloak Rebellion began when Ulfric Stormcloak and his men were arrested at 
                                        Markarth by the orders of the Thalmor,[2] due to them demanding free Talos worship from the 
                                        Legion. The Talos ban was not enforced in the province prior to this event, and at the time 
                                        of the Incident, Ulfric was considered an active Thalmor asset.

                                        The Stormcloak Rebellion, also known as the Skyrim Civil War, was a civil 
                                        war in Skyrim fought between the forces of the Empire, mobilized in western Skyrim,
                                         and the Stormcloak rebels of eastern Skyrim, in 4E 201. Many years beforehand, Jarl
                                         Ulfric Stormcloak of Windhelm formed the Stormcloaks as his personal army to carry 
                                         out his agenda. Soon after the young Torygg was appointed High King by the Moot and 
                                         ascended to the throne of Skyrim, Ulfric traveled to the High King's court in Solitude
                                         and challenged Torygg to single combat for Skyrim's throne, in order to secede from the Empire.
                                        Ulfric killed Torygg with the Thu'um, after which he stabbed with a sword, and fled the city.
                                         He was branded a murderer and traitor by the Empire.

                                        The Imperial Legion under General Tullius moved in to secure Imperial territory as 
                                        the jarls began picking sides. On the 15th of Last Seed, less than a year after the start 
                                        of the conflict, Ulfric and his men were ambushed by the Legion outside Darkwater
                                         Crossing in southern Eastmarch. After surrendering, they traveled for two days until they
                                          arrived in Helgen for execution. In a twist of fate, the village was suddenly attacked.
